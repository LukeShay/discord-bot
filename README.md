Jeffery Krueger is a simple-to-use bot for managing your server. This includes
creating roles, assigning roles, and managing your members. The goal is to
easily manage your server using role, category, and channel templates to take
the load off the server owner. In the future, we will release more fine-grain
control over role editing.

**Note: This bot is still under heavy development so there may be bugs. You can
file bug tickets at the repo listed and better yet, you can submit a pull
request :).**
